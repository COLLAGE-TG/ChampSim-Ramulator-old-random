# Common git commands are listed below,

# (1) Initializing a repository in an existing directory (a subdirectory .git will be created):
# git init

# (2) Beginning to track new files, stage files, mark merge-conflict files as resolved (i.e., add precisely this content to the next commit):
# git add [name]

# (3) Checking the status of your files:
# git status

# (4) Committing your changes:
# git commit

# Staging every tracked files and committing with the commit message 'abc def':
# git commit -a -m 'abc def'

# (5) Removing files from tracking (and your working directory):
# git rm [name]

# (6) Moving files (or renaming files):
# git mv [name_old] [name_new]

# (7) Viewing the commit history:
# git log

# Viewing the commit history from all of the branches:
# git log --all

# (8) Unstaging a staged file (undo):
# git restore --staged [name]

# unmodifying a modified file (undo):
# git restore [name]

# (9) Showing your remotes (parameter -v shows the URLs):
# git remote [-v]

# Inspecting a remote (i.e., showing a remote with more information):
# git remote show [name]

# (10) Adding remote repositories:
# git remote add [name] [path]

# (11) Fetching from a remote (i.e., just downloading the data, no merging or modifying):
# git fetch [name]

# (12) Tracking the remote (i.e., fetching and then merging data into your current branch):
# git pull

# (13) Pushing to your remote (i.e., uploading your data):
# git push [remote] [your_branch]

# (14) Renaming and removing remotes:
# git remote rename [name_old] [name_new]
# git remote remove [name]

# (15) Listing your tages:
# git tag

# Creating a lightweight tag:
# git tag v1.0.0

# (16) Creating a new branch:
# git branch [name]

# (17) Switching branches:
# git checkout [name]
# git switch [name]

# Creating and switching to a new branch:
# git checkout -b [name]
# git switch -c [name]

# (18) Deleting a branch:
# git branch -d [name]
